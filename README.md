# EES_dataLab
Run the project as a developer (still no User Interface available):

-> Atribute the WKT files path to the variable wktFiles in vcp_fire.py

-> Also in vcp_fire.py define the name of the file where you want the solution to be saved (variable fileName)

-> Run vcp_fire.py

-> When the program finishes running, open the file where you choose to save the solutions

-> Go to the end of the file and copy the correspondences array

-> Paste the array to the variable correspondences in vcp_test.py

-> Run vcp_test.py and the correspondences and polygon interpolation will be rendered
